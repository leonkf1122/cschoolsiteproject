    <h1 class="typing">History of C</h1>
    <p>The C programming language is a programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at bell labs in 1972. It was orriginally created for building the unix operating system which was built on assmebly (The closest you can get to binary while still being human readable). It wasn't until 1978 when C bacame popular due to a book called "The C Programming Language" Once C was popular, it was implimented into many mainframe computers and minicomputers. In 1983.
Here is an example of the most simple C program: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

This program simply prints the text "Hello, World!" onto the compuer's output. As you can see, C is a very low level programming language which means that it is very low down to the hardware and has little to no abstraction. Also, in this text, I will not even begin to explain how to code in C because even a simple tutorial would take up hundreds of pages.
In 1983 the American National Standards Institute created X3J11 to establish a standard specification of C.</p>
